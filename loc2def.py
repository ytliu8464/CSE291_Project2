    Inject predicted locations for movable cells into a DEF file.

    ----------
    def_path : Path
        Path to the source `.def` file (i.e., the original 3_2_place_iop.def).
    positions : Sequence[Sequence[float]]
        Iterable shaped (n, 2) containing (x, y) coordinates for *n* movable cells.
        [Note] Locations include only movable cells, and their order must matches the order of components listed in the COMPONENTS section.
    out_path : Path
        Destination path for the new `.def` file. The function appends the
        `.def` suffix automatically if it is missing.
        [Note] Save it as 3_2_place_iop.def and replace the original 3_2_place_iop.def
